/// A buffer that stores outbound control frames.
///
/// In general it is preferential to buffer outbound frames instead of passing them into the channel.
/// This is because once the frame has left the HTTP2 handler and moved into the Channel it is no longer
/// easy for us to tell how much data has been buffered. The larger the buffer grows, the more likely it
/// is that the peer is consuming resources of ours that we need for other use-cases, and in some cases
/// this may amount to an actual denial of service attack.
///
/// We have a number of buffers that handle data frames, but a similar concern applies to control frames
/// too. Control frames need to be emitted with relatively high priority, but they should only be emitted
/// when it will be reasonably possible to write them to the network. As long as it is not possible, we
/// want to store them where we can see them, and use the buffer size to make choices about the connection.
