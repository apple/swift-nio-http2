/// Keeps track of whether or not a `Channel` should be able to write based on watermarks.
///
/// A `WatermarkedFlowController` is a straightforward object that keeps track of
/// the number of to-be-written bytes in a `Channel`, as well as the trajectory of those
/// bytes. This allows a `Channel` to buffer a certain number of bytes before flipping its
/// writability state, and then allows draining to a different watermark before the state flips
/// again.
///
/// The goal here is to constrain the number of resources allocated for a task, while also ensuring
/// that `Channel` writability state doesn't flick between writable and not-writable rapidly. This produces
/// a more stable system that responds better to changes in the underlying network.
///
/// The controller keeps track of the number of pending bytes (that is, bytes that have been written but not yet
/// reached the network), as well as a high and a low watermark. If the number of pending bytes exceeds the high
/// watermark, the writability state changes to false. If the number of pending bytes is below the low watermark,
/// the writability state changes to true.
///
/// If the number of pending bytes is between the two watermarks, the writability state remains in whatever the previous
/// state was. This essentially causes a "lag" in the change of writability state: once the state flips, it will take a while
/// for the number of pending bytes to cross the other threshold to cause the state to flip again.
