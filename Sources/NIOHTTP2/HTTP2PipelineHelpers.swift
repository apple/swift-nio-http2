/// can negotiate HTTP/2 on secure connections. For example, using swift-nio-ssl,
/// you could configure the pipeline like this:
///
///     let config = TLSConfiguration.forClient(applicationProtocols: NIOHTTP2SupportedALPNProtocols)
///     let context = try SSLContext(configuration: config)
///     channel.pipeline.add(handler: OpenSSLClientHandler(context: context, serverHostname: "example.com")).then {
///         channel.pipeline.configureHTTP2SecureUpgrade(...)
///     }
///
/// Configuring for servers is very similar, but is left as an example for the reader.

    /// negotiate the inner protocol as part of the TLS handshake. For this reason, until the TLS
    /// handshake is complete, the ultimate configuration of the channel pipeline cannot be known.
    ///
    /// This function configures the pipeline with a pair of callbacks that will handle the result
    /// of the negotiation. It explicitly **does not** configure a TLS handler to actually attempt
    /// to negotiate ALPN. The supported ALPN protocols are provided in
    /// `NIOHTTP2SupportedALPNProtocols`: please ensure that the TLS handler you are using for your
    /// pipeline is appropriately configured to perform this protocol negotiation.
    ///
    /// If negotiation results in an unexpected protocol, the pipeline will close the connection
    /// and no callback will fire.
    ///
    /// This configuration is acceptable for use on both client and server channel pipelines.

    ///         pipeline has been fully mutated.
    ///     - http1PipelineConfigurator: A callback that will be invoked if HTTP/1.1 has been explicitly
