/// Unfortunately, this state machine diagram is not really entirely sufficient, as it

/// encode the validity of some of these transitions: for example, send PP or recv PP
/// are only valid for certain kinds of peers.
///
/// Ultimately, however, this diagram provides the basis for our state machine
/// implementation in this file. The state machine aims to enforce the correctness of
/// the protocol.
///
/// Remote peers that violate the protocol requirements should be notified early.
/// HTTP/2 is unusual in that the vast majority of implementations are strict about
/// RFC violations, and we should be as well. Therefore, the state machine exists to
/// constrain the remote peer's actions: if they take an action that leads to an invalid
/// state transition, we will report this to the remote peer (and to our user).
///
/// Additionally, we want to enforce that our users do not violate the correctness of the
/// protocol. In this early implementation if the user violates protocol correctness, no
/// action is taken: the stream remains in its prior state, and no frame is emitted.
/// In future it may become configurable such that if the user violates the correctness of
/// the protocol, NIO will proactively close the stream to avoid consuming resources.
///
/// ### Implementation
///
/// The core of the state machine implementation is a `State` enum. This enum demarcates all
/// valid states of the stream, and enforces only valid transitions between those states.
/// Attempts to make invalid transitions between those states will be rejected by this enum.
///
/// Additionally, this enum stores all relevant data about the stream that is associated with
/// its stream state as associated data. This ensures that it is not possible to store a stream
/// state that requires associated data without providing it.
///
/// To prevent future maintainers from being tempted to circumvent the rules in this state machine,
/// the `State` enum is wrapped in a `struct` (this `struct`, in fact) that prevents programmers
/// from directly setting the state of a stream.
///
/// Operations on the state machine are performed by calling specific functions corresponding to
/// the operation that is about to occur.
