    // context heap-allocated, and the cost of doing that is vastly higher than the cost of hashing the key a second
    // time. So for this reason we make it clear to the compiler that these methods *must* be inlined at the call-site.

    // that define the closure and then call these methods, and nothing else. So the cost of inlining this should be
