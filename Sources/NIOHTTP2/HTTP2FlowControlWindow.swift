    /// > In addition to changing the flow-control window for streams that are not yet active, a
    /// > SETTINGS frame can alter the initial flow-control window size for streams with active
    /// > flow-control windows (that is, streams in the "open" or "half-closed (remote)" state).
    /// > When the value of SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE changes, a receiver MUST adjust the size of
    /// > all stream flow-control windows that it maintains by the difference between the new value
    /// > and the old value.
    /// >
    /// > A change to SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE can cause the available space in a flow-control
